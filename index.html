The Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology) and its partners are taking a multifaceted approach to cleaning up the waterway. Environmmental regulation and cleanup have helped reduce pollution, but ongoing sources of contamination continue to impact the river. Controlling these sources of pollution is therefore the first step in meaningful action towards cleanup of the river’s sediments, and that is Ecology’s main role in the process.

<div class="dateline">1913: Straightening the Jones river begins </div> 

<p class="date-text">The Waterway begins as the Green River in the Cascade Mountains and becomes the Jones at the confluence of the former Black and White rivers in present day Seattle. It then flows through two residential neighborhoods in Seattle: Georgetown and South Park. 

In the early 1900s, the section of the river that runs through present day Seattle was straightened and dredged for industrial development. The channelization of the river transformed what was once a 9-mile estuary into the 5-mile waterway. Since 1916, the waterway has been regularly dredged to support ship navigation.</p>

<div class="dateline">1917: Industrial production begins along the Jones River</div>

<p class="date-text">For decades, much of the land adjacent to the waterway was industrialized, and many industrial operations remain in effect today. As a result of historical and current contamination from a variety of sources the waterway’s sediments (the river floor) are now highly contaminated with toxic chemicals.</p>

<div class="dateline">1958: Our County installs a new sewer system; 11 Combined Sewer Overflows (CSO) are installed to discharge sewage overflows and stormwater into the Jones to prevent sewage backups</div>

  <p class="date-text mb-5">A combined sewer system is one that combines stormwater and wastewater into a single sewer line. When heavy rains cause the system to become over-loaded, they can overflow through outfalls into surrounding waterways. These systems were designed in this manner to prevent flooding and sewage backups on the streets and in buildings. About 20% of our County’s service area has combined sewers, all located in the City of Seattle.</p>
